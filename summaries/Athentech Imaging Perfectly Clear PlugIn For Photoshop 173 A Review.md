The plug-in works as a filter in Photoshop, and you can access it from the Filter menu. Once you launch it, you will see a user-friendly interface with a split view that shows you the before and after of your photo.

The plug-in allows you to preview the changes in real time and zoom in and out of your photo.
 
One of the best features of the plug-in is its speed and accuracy. The plug-in uses patented algorithms that analyze your photo and apply the optimal corrections in seconds. You don't have to waste time tweaking multiple parameters or masking areas of your photo. The plug-in does all the work for you and delivers stunning results that match your vision.

One of the most impressive features of the plug-in is its AI scene detection. This feature analyzes your photo and applies the best corrections based on the type of scene, such as landscape, portrait, night, sunset, etc. It also detects faces and applies specific adjustments for skin, eyes, teeth, and lips. You can fine-tune these adjustments with the sliders or turn them off if you prefer.
 
The plug-in also offers a lot of benefits for portrait photographers. It can smooth and tone skin, remove blemishes and shine, enhance eyes and teeth, and even apply makeup effects.

Another feature that sets the plug-in apart from other photo editors is its ability to preserve color and detail.
